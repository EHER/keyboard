# 🎹 DIY Dactyl Manuform Project

Welcome to my Dactyl Manuform keyboard project! 🎉 This repository shares the model files and documents my journey in building this ergonomic keyboard. This is just the first step in my journey, and I will keep updating as I make progress with printing and assembly! 🚀

## 📂 Current Project Status

- **Available Files**:
  - **STL and SCAD**: Customized keyboard models ready for printing.

## 🔗 Layout Configuration

The layout was customized using an online configurator which you can find here: [Dactyl Manuform Layout Generator](https://github.com/ibnuda/dactyl-keyboard)

## 🛠️ Next Steps

1. **3D Printing the Case** 📦
   - I'm currently exploring 3D printing services available in the Netherlands and deciding on the best material to use.

2. **Collecting Components** ⚙️
   - I plan to start acquiring switches, diodes, a Pro Micro controller, and other necessary materials.

3. **Assembly and Programming** 🔧
   - After printing and acquiring components, the next phase will be the assembly and programming of the keyboard.

## 📅 Future Updates

This repository will be updated with:

- **Photos and Notes** from the printing and assembly processes.
- **Tips and Learnings** as I overcome challenges along the way.
